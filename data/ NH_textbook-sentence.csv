387,NH,1,27,P116,4,And we tried some special soba.
388,NH,1,27,P116,5,"On New Year’s Day, we visited a shrine early in the morning.  "

394,NH,1,28,P118,3,He came to school early and practiced very hard.  
395,NH,1,28,P118,4,But he injured his leg.
396,NH,1,28,P118,5,We went to the hospital and talked with him.  
397,NH,1,28,P118,6,"He said, ""Practice hard, and we can get the trophy.  """

413,NH,1,29,P120,14,"See you tomorrow, Saki."
414,NH,1,30,P122,1,43181
415,NH,1,30,P122,2,"Dear Yun-ho,"
416,NH,1,30,P122,3,I am in Shimane now.

418,NH,1,30,P122,5,I got up early this morning.  
419,NH,1,30,P122,6,I enjoyed breakfast with my family.  
420,NH,1,30,P122,7,We visited a big shrine.

422,NH,1,30,P122,9,It is raining now and a little cold.  
423,NH,1,30,P122,10,But Matsue is a beautiful city.  
424,NH,1,30,P122,11,I am having a great time.
425,NH,1,30,P122,12,"Your friend, Erika"

427,NH,1,31,P126,2,I can run fast.  
428,NH,1,31,P126,3,So I ran in the relay.
429,NH,1,31,P126,4,Our team won first place.
430,NH,1,31,P126,5,I enjoyed the day very much.
431,NH,1,32,P128,1,The Restaurant with Many Orders
432,NH,1,32,P128,2,Two hunters lost their way in a forest.  
433,NH,1,32,P128,3,"They found a restaurant, Wildcat House.  "
434,NH,1,32,P128,4,"One hunter said, ""I’m hungry. "" "
435,NH,1,32,P128,5,"""We can eat here."""
436,NH,1,32,P128,6,They read a message on the door.  
437,NH,1,32,P128,7,"It said, “We have many orders.”"
438,NH,1,32,P128,8,"""Please understand.”"
439,NH,1,32,P128,9,"In the restaurant, the hunters saw many messages.  "
440,NH,1,32,P128,10,"The messages said, "
441,NH,1,32,P128,11,"“Put your guns on the table,” "
442,NH,1,32,P128,12,"“Take off your clothes, and “Put salt and vinegar on your bodies…”"
443,NH,1,32,P129,14,"“That’s strange,” one hunter said.  "
444,NH,1,32,P129,15,“We’re not making orders.  
445,NH,1,32,P129,16,Those messages are orders from this restaurant!” 
446,NH,1,32,P129,17,“That means….
447,NH,1,32,P129,17,"Oh, no!  "
448,NH,1,32,P129,18,We’re the food!”  
449,NH,1,32,P129,19,Then the hunters saw two shiny eyes in two big keyholes of the door.  
450,NH,1,32,P129,20,“Those eyes are watching us!”
451,NH,1,32,P129,21,The hunters ran out of the restaurant.  
452,NH,1,32,P129,22,"One hunter looked back and said, "
453,NH,1,32,P129,23,“Where is the restaurant?”  
454,NH,1,32,P129,24,“It’s not there.”  
455,NH,1,32,P129,25,They stood alone in the forest.  
456,NH,1,32,P129,26,The wind blew over them.
457,NH,2,1,P4,1,"Hello, everyone."
458,NH,2,1,P4,2,I'm Ando Saki.
459,NH,2,1,P4,3,I went to Fukui with my familiy two weeks ago.
460,NH,2,1,P4,4,This is a picture of a dinosaur museum.
461,NH,2,1,P4,5,You can get a lot of information about dinosaurs and natural history at the museum.
462,NH,2,1,P4,6,"We enjoyed delicious food, too."
463,NH,2,1,P4,7,"For example, we ate Echizen soba."
464,NH,2,1,P4,8,We had a good time.
465,NH,2,1,P4,9,Thank you.
466,NH,2,1,P5,10,How did you get to Fukui?
467,NH,2,1,P5,11,We went there by car.
468,NH,2,1,P5,12,Can we see a tyrannosaurus in the museum?
469,NH,2,1,P5,13,"Yes, we can."
470,NH,2,1,P5,14,How many hours did you spend at the museum?
471,NH,2,1,P5,15,We spent three hours there!
472,NH,2,1,P5,16,We saw a lot of dinosaurs.
473,NH,2,2,P6,1,Back-to-School Sale!

486,NH,2,3,P8,7,I was looking for my pencil case.
487,NH,2,3,P8,8,"Oh, did you buy that?"
488,NH,2,3,P8,9,It's nice.
489,NH,2,3,P8,10,Thanks.

497,NH,2,4,P10,7,My school has lots of fun events.
498,NH,2,4,P10,8,"Last month, we had a dance."
499,NH,2,4,P10,9,Both students and teachers danced in the cafeteria on that day.
500,NH,2,4,P10,10,It was fun!
501,NH,2,4,P10,11,What events do you have at your school?
502,NH,2,4,P12,12,I was surprised.
503,NH,2,4,P12,13,Your school is different from ours.
504,NH,2,4,P12,14,"In Japan, the school year starts in April."
505,NH,2,4,P12,15,You all look happy!
506,NH,2,4,P12,16,"Our school has fun events, like a chorus contest."
507,NH,2,4,P12,17,Each class sings together on stage.
508,NH,2,4,P12,18,You wrote your message at 4:25 a.m. Japan time.
509,NH,2,4,P12,19,I was sleeping then!
510,NH,2,4,P12,20,"Now you're sleeping, right?"
511,NH,2,4,P12,21,"We live far away from each other, but we can be friends."
512,NH,2,4,P12,22,Let's keep in touch.
513,NH,2,5,P16,1,"Saturday, April 28"
514,NH,2,5,P16,2,I cleaned my room in the morning.
515,NH,2,5,P16,3,"After lunch, I went to the library and borrowed some books."
516,NH,2,5,P16,4,"In the evening, I watched a soccer game on TV."

518,NH,2,5,P16,6,"Sunday, April 29"
519,NH,2,5,P16,7,I went fishing at the Midori River With my friends.
520,NH,2,5,P16,8,We caught many fish.
521,NH,2,5,P16,9,"Other people were fishing there, too."
522,NH,2,5,P16,10,We gave some fish to them.
523,NH,2,5,P16,11,We had a good time.
524,NH,2,6,P18,1,"Hi, Deepa."

539,NH,2,6,P20,16,Enjoy your stay.
540,NH,2,6,P20,17,Thank you.
541,NH,2,6,P22,18,Look at that clock tower beside the Thames.
542,NH,2,6,P22,19,It's about 150 years old.
543,NH,2,6,P22,20,Many people call it Big Ben.
544,NH,2,6,P22,21,"Maybe the name comes from its builder, Benjamin Hall."
545,NH,2,6,P22,22,He was a very big man.
546,NH,2,6,P22,23,"Now, we're going to ride that big Ferris wheel."
547,NH,2,6,P22,24,It's about 20 years old.
548,NH,2,6,P22,25,People call it the London Eye.
549,NH,2,6,P22,26,It's 135 meters tall.
550,NH,2,6,P22,27,We can see a great view from the top.
551,NH,2,6,P22,28,"In London, we can find both old buildings and new ones."
552,NH,2,6,P22,29,It's really interesting.
553,NH,2,6,P24,30,Emi and I are at Oxford University now.
554,NH,2,6,P24,31,It took about one hour from London to Oxford by train.
555,NH,2,6,P24,32,Look.
556,NH,2,6,P24,33,This is the dining hall.
557,NH,2,6,P24,34,Maybe you know it from the Harry Potter movies.
558,NH,2,6,P24,35,I love them.
559,NH,2,6,P24,36,So I remember this hall from many scenes.
560,NH,2,6,P24,37,Now I'm looking at the real thing.
561,NH,2,6,P24,38,It's amazing.
562,NH,2,6,P24,39,We can see so many things in our travels.
563,NH,2,6,P24,40,The world is full of interesting places.
564,NH,2,7,P28,1,Excuse me. 
565,NH,2,7,P28,2,May I ask you a favor?
566,NH,2,7,P28,3,Sure.
567,NH,2,7,P28,4,Could you take our picture?
568,NH,2,7,P28,5,All right. 
569,NH,2,7,P28,6,Say cheese!
570,NH,2,7,P28,7,"Could you take another one, please?"
571,NH,2,7,P28,8,No problem.
572,NH,2,8,P32,1,Don’t forget:
573,NH,2,8,P32,2,Wash your hands in the right way.
574,NH,2,8,P32,3,Look in the mirror to check your appearance.
575,NH,2,8,P32,4,Greet customers with a smile to welcome them.
576,NH,2,8,P32,5,I’m here to learn about jobs in restaurants.
577,NH,2,8,P34,6,"Deepa, where did you go on Career Day?"
578,NH,2,8,P34,7,I went to an Italian restaurant.
579,NH,2,8,P34,8,I want to be a chef.
580,NH,2,8,P34,9,Wow.
581,NH,2,8,P34,10,How was it?
582,NH,2,8,P34,11,"It was interesting, but I got tired."
583,NH,2,8,P34,12,"I tried to learn the whole menu, but I couldn’t."
584,NH,2,8,P34,13,I see.
585,NH,2,8,P34,14,I went to a newspaper company.
586,NH,2,8,P34,15,I want to be a journalist.
587,NH,2,8,P34,16,Sounds interesting.
588,NH,2,8,P34,17,I want to hear about it.
589,NH,2,9,P36,1,Kota and I went to a newspaper company on Career Day.
590,NH,2,9,P36,2,"Mr. Suzuki, a journalist, showed us around the office."
591,NH,2,9,P36,3,Then he took us out to interview a soccer player.
592,NH,2,9,P36,4,"Mr. Suzuki told us, "
593,NH,2,9,P36,5,“Newspapers are important to people everywhere.
594,NH,2,9,P36,6,We need to report the news every day.
595,NH,2,9,P36,7,We have many things to do.”
596,NH,2,9,P36,8,Now I read newspapers every morning.
597,NH,2,9,P36,9,"For my future, I have many things to learn."
598,NH,2,9,P38,10,I went to a soccer stadium to interview Miyama Aya.
599,NH,2,9,P38,11,"Mr. Suzuki, a journalist, took us there."
600,NH,2,9,P38,12,Ms. Miyama played for some teams in the United States.
601,NH,2,9,P38,13,"I want to play soccer abroad in the future, too."
602,NH,2,9,P38,14,So I asked her for some advice.
603,NH,2,9,P38,15,"She said, "
604,NH,2,9,P38,16,“You need to get along with your teammates.
605,NH,2,9,P38,17,You need to break the language barrier.
606,NH,2,9,P38,18,Get a lot of experience.
607,NH,2,9,P38,19,It’s all about your heart.”
608,NH,2,9,P38,20,Her message impressed me.
609,NH,2,9,P38,21,"To play abroad is not easy, but I really want to try."
610,NH,2,10,P42,1,"Hi, Erika."
611,NH,2,10,P42,2,Guess what!
612,NH,2,10,P42,3,We want to hold a farewell party for you.
613,NH,2,10,P42,4,"I’m going to invite our teachers, too."
614,NH,2,10,P42,5,Do you have any plans next Sunday afternoon?
615,NH,2,10,P42,6,Tell us your schedule.
616,NH,2,10,P42,7,"Your friend, Yun-ho"
617,NH,2,10,P42,8,"Hi, Yun-ho."
618,NH,2,10,P42,9,Thank you for the party.
619,NH,2,10,P42,10,I’m so happy.
620,NH,2,10,P42,11,Your plan surprised me very much.
621,NH,2,10,P42,12,I’m free on Sunday.
622,NH,2,10,P42,13,I can’t wait!
623,NH,2,10,P42,14,"Bye for now, Erika"
624,NH,2,11,P46,1,I want to be a computer programmer.
625,NH,2,11,P46,2,I have two reasons.
626,NH,2,11,P46,3,"First, I like to surf the Internet."
627,NH,2,11,P46,4,"Second, I want to make useful websites."
628,NH,2,11,P46,5,So the job is perfect for me.
629,NH,2,11,P46,6,"To be a good programmer, I study math, science, and English really hard."
630,NH,2,12,P48,1,"Hello, everyone."
631,NH,2,12,P48,2,I’m Kevin Parker.
632,NH,2,12,P48,3,I’m from the United States.
633,NH,2,12,P48,4,I’m going to talk about my dream.
634,NH,2,12,P48,5,"I love nature, and I like to hike in the woods."
635,NH,2,12,P48,6,My favorite place is Yosemite National Park.
636,NH,2,12,P48,7,It’s a World Heritage Site.
637,NH,2,12,P48,8,It’s famous for its very tall trees.
638,NH,2,12,P48,9,People call them giant sequoias.
639,NH,2,12,P48,10,I really love the nature in Yosemite.
640,NH,2,12,P48,11,So I want to be a park ranger there.
641,NH,2,12,P48,12,Rangers work for the park to protect its environment.
642,NH,2,12,P48,13,My cousin works as a ranger in Yosemite.
643,NH,2,12,P48,14,She knows a lot about nature.
644,NH,2,12,P48,15,So I often ask her about it.
645,NH,2,12,P48,16,"In the future, I hope to teach the importance of nature to the next generation."
646,NH,2,12,P48,17,Thank you.
647,NH,2,13,P50,1,Mary lived in the country.
648,NH,2,13,P50,2,"Ben, her neighbor, was a good friend."
649,NH,2,13,P50,3,"One day, they found a cow."
650,NH,2,13,P50,4,"Hey, that’s my cow."
651,NH,2,13,P50,5,"No, that’s my cow."
652,NH,2,13,P50,6,What?
653,NH,2,13,P50,7,Why do you think so?
654,NH,2,13,P50,8,It has the same short legs as my other cows.
655,NH,2,13,P50,9,"No, Mary."
656,NH,2,13,P50,10,"It has the same long, black tail as my other cows."
657,NH,2,13,P50,11,It’s mine.
658,NH,2,13,P50,12,What are you saying?
659,NH,2,13,P50,13,It’s my cow!
660,NH,2,13,P50,14,"After this little fight, Ben took the cow."
661,NH,2,13,P51,15,A week passed.
662,NH,2,13,P51,16,Someone knocked at Mary’s door.
663,NH,2,13,P51,17,Hello.
664,NH,2,13,P51,18,Who are you?
665,NH,2,13,P51,19,Hello. 
666,NH,2,13,P51,20,I’m a traveling carpenter.
667,NH,2,13,P51,21,Please call me Pat.
668,NH,2,13,P51,22,I’m looking for work.
669,NH,2,13,P51,23,Do you have any work for me?
670,NH,2,13,P51,24,"Yes, Pat."
671,NH,2,13,P51,25,Look at that small stream over there.
672,NH,2,13,P51,26,"Ben, my bad neighbor, made it last week."
673,NH,2,13,P51,27,"Oh, you sound so angry."
674,NH,2,13,P51,28,Can you make a big fence along the stream?
675,NH,2,13,P51,29,I don’t want to see his face.
676,NH,2,13,P51,30,OK.
677,NH,2,13,P51,31,No problem.
678,NH,2,13,P52,32,Pat worked hard and fast.
679,NH,2,13,P52,33,"At sunset, he finished his work."
680,NH,2,13,P52,34,Mary came to see it.
681,NH,2,13,P52,35,She was very surprised.
682,NH,2,13,P52,36,What’s this?
683,NH,2,13,P52,37,"Well, I built a bridge over the stream."
684,NH,2,13,P52,38,Why did you do that?
685,NH,2,13,P52,39,Take down this bridge right now!
686,NH,2,13,P52,40,"Then the door of Ben’s house opened, and Ben came out of his house."
687,NH,2,13,P52,41,Wait!
688,NH,2,13,P52,42,Don’t take it down!
689,NH,2,13,P53,43,Ben ran across the bridge and came to talk to Mary.
690,NH,2,13,P53,44,"I’m sorry about the cow, Mary."
691,NH,2,13,P53,45,"Please take it back, and be my friend again."
692,NH,2,13,P53,46,I don’t want to lose your friendship.
693,NH,2,13,P53,47,"Oh, Ben. I don’t want to lose yours, either."
694,NH,2,13,P53,48,"Well, the bridge worked!"
695,NH,2,13,P53,49,You both look very happy.
696,NH,2,13,P53,50,"Thank you, Pat."
697,NH,2,13,P53,51,You built a “bridge” between us.
698,NH,2,13,P53,52,Yes.
699,NH,2,13,P53,53,"Please stay here, Pat."
700,NH,2,13,P53,54,We have a lot of work for you.
701,NH,2,13,P53,55,"Thank you, but I can’t."
702,NH,2,13,P53,56,I have many other bridges to build.
703,NH,2,13,P53,57,He left with a smile.
704,NH,2,14,P54,1,Homestay Advice

711,NH,2,14,P56,8,"Yes, thank you."

720,NH,2,14,P58,17,Everyone in my host family is kind to me.
721,NH,2,14,P58,18,But my host mother always gives me too much food.
722,NH,2,14,P58,19,"Do I have to eat everything, or can I tell her?"
723,NH,2,14,P58,20,Teacher’s  answer
724,NH,2,14,P58,21,You must tell your host mother.
725,NH,2,14,P58,22,"Say, “I’m sorry."
726,NH,2,14,P58,23,"The food tastes delicious, but I can’t eat that much.”"

730,NH,2,14,P58,27,It worked!
731,NH,2,14,P58,28,Now I can really enjoy my meals.
732,NH,2,14,P60,29,I’m sad.  
733,NH,2,14,P60,30,My host family is very busy.
734,NH,2,14,P60,31,"They don’t take me anywhere, so I have nothing to do on weekends."
735,NH,2,14,P60,32,Saki’s host family always takes her to interesting places.
736,NH,2,14,P60,33,Teacher’s answer
737,NH,2,14,P60,34,"Carlo, you must not compare host families."

744,NH,2,14,P60,41,I found my family’s good points.
745,NH,2,14,P60,42,They try hard to talk with me.
746,NH,2,14,P60,43,They like to laugh.
747,NH,2,14,P60,44,"Actually, they’re very friendly."

758,NH,2,15,P64,10,Why don’t you come?
759,NH,2,15,P64,11,"I’m sorry, but I can’t."
760,NH,2,15,P64,12,I have to look after my neighbor’s children.
761,NH,2,15,P64,13,Fine. 
762,NH,2,15,P64,14,Maybe some other time.

771,NH,2,16,P70,9,Bumps?
772,NH,2,16,P70,10,"No, I didn’t."

774,NH,2,16,P70,12,What’s a universal design?
775,NH,2,16,P70,13,It’s a design for everyone.
776,NH,2,16,P70,14,I think universal designs are great.
777,NH,2,16,P72,15,I used a wheelchair for the first time in my life today.
778,NH,2,16,P72,16,"When I sat in it, I couldn’t use it easily."
779,NH,2,16,P72,17,I felt a little scared.
780,NH,2,16,P72,18,"I tried to get on a bus, but it was difficult."
781,NH,2,16,P72,19,The bus door was wide.
782,NH,2,16,P72,20,"Even so, it was very hard."
783,NH,2,16,P72,21,I needed a lot of help.
784,NH,2,16,P72,22,I learned an important lesson from this experience.
785,NH,2,16,P72,23,"From now on, when I see someone in need, I’ll give them a hand."
786,NH,2,16,P74,24,Universal design products are all around us.
787,NH,2,16,P74,25,"For example, look at this plastic bottle."
788,NH,2,16,P74,26,We can hold it easily because it has a special shape.
789,NH,2,16,P74,27,"Now, look at this picture."
790,NH,2,16,P74,28,Do you see the ramp by the stairs?
791,NH,2,16,P74,29,"If you’re in a wheelchair, or pushing a stroller, you can use the ramp."

793,NH,2,16,P74,31,I think it’s great because the products are useful for everyone.

825,NH,2,18,P82,18,"Yes, there are."
826,NH,2,18,P82,19,A fan and a hand towel.
827,NH,2,18,P82,20,The performer uses them in different ways.
828,NH,2,18,P84,21,"These days, rakugo is spreading to other countries."
829,NH,2,18,P84,22,"Their cultures are different, so rakugo performers change parts of the stories."
830,NH,2,18,P84,23,"Then, everyone can understand them."
831,NH,2,18,P84,24,Laughter is a strong bridge.

875,NH,2,21,P94,7,Don’t you think they look interesting?
876,NH,2,21,P94,8,I live in one of these houses.
877,NH,2,21,P94,9,It’s huge.

885,NH,2,22,P96,1,“Why did my grandmother die?
886,NH,2,22,P96,2,Why did everyone leave me?” cried a boy of fourteen.
887,NH,2,22,P96,3,“I hate my father and mother.”
888,NH,2,22,P96,4,The sun was bright in the blue sky above him.
889,NH,2,22,P96,5,But the boy could not see it because he was blind.
890,NH,2,22,P96,6,The boy was born in 1952 in Okinawa.
891,NH,2,22,P96,7,His father was Mexican-American and his mother was Japanese.
892,NH,2,22,P96,8,Both of them left home when he was a baby.
893,NH,2,22,P96,9,So his grandmother took care of him.
894,NH,2,22,P97,10,The boy’s name was Aragaki Tsutomu.
895,NH,2,22,P97,11,He liked music very much.
896,NH,2,22,P97,12,"One day, he heard some hymns on the radio."
897,NH,2,22,P97,13,He was interested in them.
898,NH,2,22,P97,14,"He wanted to hear some other hymns, and so he went to a church."
899,NH,2,22,P97,15,"At the church, he met the minister."
900,NH,2,22,P97,16,Tsutomu told him about his life.
901,NH,2,22,P97,17,The minister listened to him quietly.
902,NH,2,22,P97,18,"When Tsutomu stopped talking, he found that the minister was crying."
903,NH,2,22,P97,19,"“Oh, he understands me,” Tsutomu thought."
904,NH,2,22,P98,20,"The minister said, “Tsutomu, do you want to come and stay with us?"
905,NH,2,22,P98,21,My wife and children will welcome you.”
906,NH,2,22,P98,22,"Tsutomu felt happy and said, “Yes.”"
907,NH,2,22,P98,23,Tsutomu started a new life as a member of the minister’s warm family.
908,NH,2,22,P98,24,"Tsutomu wanted to become a minister, too."
909,NH,2,22,P98,25,So he went to college and studied very hard.
910,NH,2,22,P98,26,He also learned singing and sang in church.
911,NH,2,22,P98,27,His hatred of his parents began to fade.
912,NH,2,22,P98,28,He decided to help other people in need.
913,NH,2,22,P99,29,"Tsutomu’s Italian voice trainer once said to him, “Your voice is a gift from God, and also from your father."
914,NH,2,22,P99,30,You’re the only one in the world with a voice like that.”
915,NH,2,22,P99,31,Tsutomu is now proud of his singing.
916,NH,2,22,P99,32,"His motto is “Try to be the only one, not just number one.”"
917,NH,2,22,P99,33,We can feel the brightness and sadness of Okinawa through his beautiful voice in his song Sugarcane Fields.
918,NH,2,23,P100,1,Let’s compare sea animals.
919,NH,2,23,P100,2,The dolphin is larger than the tuna.
920,NH,2,23,P100,3,But the tuna swims faster than the dolphin.
921,NH,2,23,P100,4,The blue whale is the largest of all animals.
922,NH,2,23,P100,5,It is longer than a 25-meter swimming pool!
923,NH,2,24,P102,1,"Thank you, Deepa."
924,NH,2,24,P102,2,"I love dolphins, so I really enjoyed your book."
925,NH,2,24,P102,3,"Oh, then you should see this movie, Dolphin Tale."
926,NH,2,24,P102,4,It’s more interesting than this book.
927,NH,2,24,P102,5,Really?
928,NH,2,24,P102,6,Yes. Don’t miss the ending.
929,NH,2,24,P102,7,That scene is the most impressive in the movie.
930,NH,2,24,P102,8,OK. 
931,NH,2,24,P102,9,I’ll check it out.
932,NH,2,24,P102,10,Let’s talk about the movie tomorrow.
933,NH,2,25,P104,1,Sawyer is a shy 11-year-old boy.
934,NH,2,25,P104,2,"One day, he sees a dolphin on a beach."
935,NH,2,25,P104,3,The dolphin has a serious tail injury.
936,NH,2,25,P104,4,Sawyer tries to help her.
937,NH,2,25,P104,5,Soon some people from an aquarium come to rescue her.
938,NH,2,25,P104,6,They name her Winter and take good care of her.
939,NH,2,25,P104,7,Sawyer visits the aquarium every day to see her.
940,NH,2,25,P104,8,Winter knows that Sawyer saved her life.
941,NH,2,25,P104,9,So she looks happy when she sees Sawyer.
942,NH,2,25,P104,10,Winter becomes his best friend.
943,NH,2,25,P104,11,"Winter looks happy, but her condition does not get better."
944,NH,2,25,P106,12,Winter’s injury is very bad.
945,NH,2,25,P106,13,The doctor must cut off her tail.
946,NH,2,25,P106,14,"Without a tail, she’ll die."
947,NH,2,25,P106,15,But making an artificial one is very expensive.
948,NH,2,25,P106,16,"People at the aquarium are sad, but they can’t do anything."
949,NH,2,25,P106,17,Sawyer thinks of an idea.
950,NH,2,25,P106,18,He plans a charity event with volunteers.
951,NH,2,25,P106,19,"Many people come, and Sawyer collects money for Winter."
952,NH,2,25,P106,20,Sawyer is no longer shy.
953,NH,2,25,P106,21,"Finally, Winter gets a new tail."
954,NH,2,25,P106,22,It’s the best thing for her.
955,NH,2,25,P106,23,She can swim as well as other dolphins.
956,NH,2,25,P106,24,This movie is a true story of the bond between people and animals.
957,NH,2,26,P110,1,Hello. 
958,NH,2,26,P110,2,May I help you?
959,NH,2,26,P110,3,"Yes, please."
960,NH,2,26,P110,4,I like these jackets.
961,NH,2,26,P110,5,We have more in the back.
962,NH,2,26,P110,6,What color are you looking for?
963,NH,2,26,P110,7,Something bright.
964,NH,2,26,P110,8,How about this orange one?
965,NH,2,26,P110,9,"Oh, that’s cool."
966,NH,2,26,P110,10,But it’s too big for me.
967,NH,2,26,P110,11,Shall I show you a smaller one?
968,NH,2,26,P110,12,"Yes, please."
969,NH,2,26,P110,13,"Oh, this is nice."
970,NH,2,26,P110,14,How much is it?
971,NH,2,26,P110,15,It’s sixty dollars.
972,NH,2,26,P110,16,OK.
973,NH,2,26,P110,17,I’ll take it.
974,NH,2,27,P114,1,My favorite comic is Star Trip.
975,NH,2,27,P114,2,It’s a science fiction story.
976,NH,2,27,P114,3,A hero and his friends travel to the stars to search for treasure.
977,NH,2,27,P114,4,It’s the most popular comic this year.
978,NH,2,27,P114,5,I like it because there are many cool characters in it.
979,NH,2,27,P114,6,"If you’re interested, I can tell you more about it."
980,NH,2,28,P116,1,"Hello, everyone.  I’m Anita Lopez from Venezuela."
981,NH,2,28,P116,2,I like classical music.
982,NH,2,28,P116,3,I like it because it’s very emotional.
983,NH,2,28,P116,4,"My family is poor, but I learn music thanks to a special program."
984,NH,2,28,P116,5,The program is “El Sistema.”
985,NH,2,28,P116,6,"In 1975, the government started it to help poor children in Venezuela."
986,NH,2,28,P116,7,"In this program, children can borrow instruments and become a member of an orchestra."
987,NH,2,28,P116,8,The program is free.
988,NH,2,28,P116,9,Can you believe it?
989,NH,2,28,P116,10,Now El Sistema is one of the most famous educational programs in the world.
990,NH,2,28,P116,11,"More than 350,000 children are members."
991,NH,2,28,P116,12,I joined the program five years ago.
992,NH,2,28,P116,13,I play the violin.
993,NH,2,28,P116,14,I really enjoy playing music with my friends in the orchestra.
994,NH,2,28,P116,15,My life is happier than before.
995,NH,2,28,P116,16,I think the power of music is great.
996,NH,2,29,P118,1,Imagine that you live on a high mountain.  
997,NH,2,29,P118,2,There is no electricity or gas.  
998,NH,2,29,P118,3,You need to eat every day.  
999,NH,2,29,P118,4,So you have to find ways to heat and cook food.  
1000,NH,2,29,P118,5,"When you are in a place like this, you can use a solar cooker.  "
1001,NH,2,29,P118,6,You can also use one after a disaster.
1002,NH,2,29,P118,7,A solar cooker is a tool to heat food in a pot.
1003,NH,2,29,P118,8,It collects sunlight in the pot.  
1004,NH,2,29,P118,9,"It can cook rice, boil eggs, and even bake cakes."
1005,NH,2,29,P119,10,A solar cooker is helpful to people in developing countries.  
1006,NH,2,29,P119,11,Why?
1007,NH,2,29,P119,12,"First, making a solar cooker does not cost much.  "
1008,NH,2,29,P119,13,You can make one with only cardboard and aluminum foil.
1009,NH,2,29,P119,14,"Second, people in developing countries can get cleaner water by boiling it with a solar cooker."
1010,NH,2,29,P119,15,Drinking water from rivers and lakes is one of the biggest causes of disease.
1011,NH,2,29,P119,16,"Third, a solar cooker is safe because it does not make smoke.  "
1012,NH,2,29,P119,17,More than one third of the people in the world burn firewood indoors to cook.  
1013,NH,2,29,P119,18,A lot of children die from its smoke.
1014,NH,2,29,P120,19,A solar cooker can solve another big problem because it does not use any fuel.  
1015,NH,2,29,P120,20,People need a lot of wood to cook every day.  
1016,NH,2,29,P120,21,"Collecting wood is hard work, especially for women and children.  "
1017,NH,2,29,P120,22,"With a solar cooker, they do not have to collect wood anymore."
1018,NH,2,29,P120,23,More than two billion people use wood to heat food.  
1019,NH,2,29,P120,24,Cutting trees in forests adds to global warming. 
1020,NH,2,29,P120,25,"If you use one solar cooker, you can save about 550 kilograms of wood every year."
1021,NH,2,29,P121,26,We use a lot of energy in our daily lives.  
1022,NH,2,29,P121,27,"We get most of this energy from gas and oil, but they are limited."
1023,NH,2,29,P121,28,A solar cooker uses solar power.  
1024,NH,2,29,P121,29,It is an example of renewable energy. 
1025,NH,2,29,P121,30,"There are other examples of this energy, such as water, wind, and natural heat in the ground."
1026,NH,2,29,P121,31,"Renewable energy facilities often cost a lot, but you may find a simple idea, like a solar cooker.  "
1027,NH,2,29,P121,32,Sometimes a simple idea has the power to change the world for the better.
1028,NH,3,1,P4,1,"Hello, everyone."
1029,NH,3,1,P4,2,I'm Ito Kota.
1030,NH,3,1,P4,3,I'm going to talk about Canada.
1031,NH,3,1,P4,4,Look at the map and the table.
1032,NH,3,1,P4,5,Canada is north of the United States.
1033,NH,3,1,P4,6,"It's the world's second largest country, but its population is only thirty-three million."
1034,NH,3,1,P4,7,"There are many places to see in Canada, like Niagara Falls and Canadian Rockies."
1035,NH,3,1,P4,8,A lot of people go to Canada to enjoy its beautiful nature.
1036,NH,3,1,P4,9,I want to go and see it myself.
1037,NH,3,1,P4,10,Thank you.
1038,NH,3,2,P6,1,This is a famous painting by Vincent van Gogh.
1039,NH,3,2,P6,2,It is loved by many people.
1040,NH,3,2,P6,3,Van Gogh was influenced by ukiyo-e.
1041,NH,3,2,P6,4,Some ukiyo-e prints are shown in this painting.
1042,NH,3,2,P6,5,They were brought from Japan to Europe.
1043,NH,3,2,P8,6,Was this picture also painted by the same person?
1044,NH,3,2,P8,7,"Yes, it was."
1045,NH,3,2,P8,8,When was it painted?
1046,NH,3,2,P8,9,Is the year written in the book?
1047,NH,3,2,P8,10,Yes.
1048,NH,3,2,P8,11,It was painted in 1887.
1049,NH,3,2,P8,12,I see.
1050,NH,3,2,P8,13,"At that time, Japanese culture was popular in Europe."
1051,NH,3,2,P8,14,Really?
1052,NH,3,2,P8,15,How about now?
1053,NH,3,2,P10,16,Japanese Pop Culture around the World
1054,NH,3,2,P10,17,Japanese manga and anime characters are loved in many countries.
1055,NH,3,2,P10,18,Doraemon is one good example.
1056,NH,3,2,P10,19,"In 2012, he was given special birthday parties in Hong Kong and Taiwan."
1057,NH,3,2,P10,20,"Many Doraemon fans celebrated his 100-year ""before'' birthday."
1058,NH,3,2,P10,21,"Another popular example of Japanese pop culture is the word ""kawaii.''"
1059,NH,3,2,P10,22,"""Kawaii '' is also used outside Japan now."
1060,NH,3,2,P10,23,A lot of people are attracted by kawaii culture such as Hello Kitty goods and other unique designs.
1061,NH,3,2,P12,24,"Friday, April 22"
1062,NH,3,2,P12,25,I read about ukiyo-e and Japanese pop culture today.
1063,NH,3,2,P12,26,"I knew little about them before, but I learned that both are much loved in foreign countries."
1064,NH,3,2,P12,27,It makes me proud of Japan.
1065,NH,3,2,P12,28,I also learned that ukiyo-e was pop culture in Japan during the Edo period.
1066,NH,3,2,P12,29,"In fact, ukiyo-e prints were sold like posters."
1067,NH,3,2,P12,30,I think manga and anime will be traditional Japanese arts like ukiyo-e someday.
1068,NH,3,2,P12,31,Maybe even kawaii culture can become a part of Japanese tradition.
1069,NH,3,2,P12,32,This idea makes me happy.
1070,NH,3,3,P16,1,"Help yourself, Erika."
1071,NH,3,3,P16,2,Thank you.
1072,NH,3,3,P16,3,Would you like some more?
1073,NH,3,3,P16,4,"Yes, please. "
1074,NH,3,3,P16,5,It's very good.
1075,NH,3,3,P16,6,I'm glad you like it.
1076,NH,3,3,P16,7,May I have some water?
1077,NH,3,3,P16,8,Of course. 
1078,NH,3,3,P16,9,Here you are.
1079,NH,3,3,P16,10,This dish is delicious. 
1080,NH,3,3,P16,11,What is it called?
1081,NH,3,3,P16,12,It's called meat loaf.
1082,NH,3,3,P16,13,It's made from beef.
1083,NH,3,3,P16,14,Would you like another piece of meat loaf?
1084,NH,3,3,P16,15,"No, thank you."
1085,NH,3,3,P16,16,I'm full.
1086,NH,3,4,P18,1,This is called a yunomi.
1087,NH,3,4,P18,2,It's used when you drink tea.
1088,NH,3,4,P18,3,A yunomi usually doesn't have a handle.
1089,NH,3,4,P18,4,This yunomi is Arita ware from Saga Prefecture.
1090,NH,3,4,P18,5,There are many kinds of yunomi in Japan.
1091,NH,3,4,P18,6,Some of them are really beautiful.
1092,NH,3,5,P20,1,"Hi, everyone."
1093,NH,3,5,P20,2,My name is Maile Johnson.
1094,NH,3,5,P20,3,I'm a high school student in Hawaii.
1095,NH,3,5,P20,4,"Last summer, I met Sayuri, a 17-year-old Japanese student."
1096,NH,3,5,P20,5,She visited Hawaii to study English during her summer vacation.
1097,NH,3,5,P20,6,She stayed at our house for two weeks as a homestay student.
1098,NH,3,5,P20,7,We became very good friends.
1099,NH,3,5,P20,8,"One day, she said to me, "
1100,NH,3,5,P20,9,Your father often wears aloha shirts to work.
1101,NH,3,5,P20,10,I like them.
1102,NH,3,5,P20,11,They're very Hawaiian.''
1103,NH,3,5,P20,12,"""Yes, I like them, too."
1104,NH,3,5,P20,13,I also love Japanese clothes.
1105,NH,3,5,P20,14,"I'm interested in Japanese kimonos, ''"
1106,NH,3,5,P20,15,I answered.
1107,NH,3,5,P20,16,"Actually, the first aloha shirts in Hawaii were made by people from Asia."
1108,NH,3,5,P20,17,They were made from Japanese kimonos.
1109,NH,3,5,P20,18,I told this story to Sayuri.
1110,NH,3,5,P20,19,It made her curious.
1111,NH,3,5,P20,20,"""How were the kimonos brought from Japan to Hawaii? ''"
1112,NH,3,5,P20,20,she asked.
1113,NH,3,5,P20,21,Today aloha shirts are known around the world as example of Hawaiian culture.
1114,NH,3,5,P20,22,You can see them in many places.
1115,NH,3,5,P20,23,Cultures are mixing and the world is becoming smaller.
1116,NH,3,5,P20,24,Isn't that great?
1117,NH,3,6,P22,1,"Hi, everyone!"
1118,NH,3,6,P22,2,I'm Ricardo Takahashi from Rio de Janeiro.
1119,NH,3,6,P22,3,My grandfather is Japanese.
1120,NH,3,6,P22,4,I've lived in Japan for a month.
1121,NH,3,6,P22,5,I've loved Japanese anime since I was a little child.
1122,NH,3,6,P22,6,I watched some programs in Brazil.
1123,NH,3,6,P22,7,I'm glad I could finally come to Japan.
1124,NH,3,6,P24,8,"Hey, Kota."
1125,NH,3,6,P24,9,"You're on the soccer team, aren't you?"
1126,NH,3,6,P24,10,Yes.
1127,NH,3,6,P24,11,How did you know that?
1128,NH,3,6,P24,12,"Paulo, your coach, told me about you."
1129,NH,3,6,P24,13,He taught me soccer when he was in Brazil.
1130,NH,3,6,P24,14,Really?
1131,NH,3,6,P24,15,How long have you known him?
1132,NH,3,6,P24,16,For about eight years.
1133,NH,3,6,P24,17,Now he often comes to our house in Japan.
1134,NH,3,6,P24,18,Wow.
1135,NH,3,6,P24,19,It's a small world!
1136,NH,3,6,P26,20,Look at this picture.
1137,NH,3,6,P26,21,"It looks like the sea, doesn't it?"
1138,NH,3,6,P26,22,"Actually, it's a river, the Amazon."
1139,NH,3,6,P26,23,It's the largest river in the world.
1140,NH,3,6,P26,24,The Amazon has been important to Brazil for many years.
1141,NH,3,6,P26,25,Its water power produces about eighty percent of Brazil's electricity.
1142,NH,3,6,P26,26,"The Amazon has been helpful to everyone here, too."
1143,NH,3,6,P26,27,It runs through a huge rain forest.
1144,NH,3,6,P26,28,That forest produces about twenty percent of the world's oxygen.
1145,NH,3,6,P26,29,The oxygen in this classroom may come from Brazil!
1146,NH,3,6,P28,30,The rain forest of the Amazon has many unique animals.
1147,NH,3,6,P28,31,"These animals have been there for a long time, but they're losing their home now."
1148,NH,3,6,P28,32,People are destroying the rain forest.
1149,NH,3,6,P28,33,It has continued for years.
1150,NH,3,6,P28,34,"Between the 1970s and 2010, about 740,000 square kilometers of the forest disappeared."
1151,NH,3,6,P28,35,That's almost twice the size of Japan.
1152,NH,3,6,P28,36,I've been worried about this problem since I was in elementary school.
1153,NH,3,6,P28,37,I want to become a scientist and do something for the plants and animals of the Amazon.
1154,NH,3,6,P28,38,The Amazon is treasure of the world.

1156,NH,3,7,P32,2,"Dear Jiro,"
1157,NH,3,7,P32,3,My name is Erika.
1158,NH,3,7,P32,4,I am a junior high school student in New York.
1159,NH,3,7,P32,5,"I lived in Japan before, and I have been a big fan of yours since then."
1160,NH,3,7,P32,6,"Today, I saw the game at Yankee Stadium."
1161,NH,3,7,P32,7,I was really impressed when you hit a home run.
1162,NH,3,7,P32,8,I have a question.
1163,NH,3,7,P32,9,You have been successful in the United States.
1164,NH,3,7,P32,10,What is your next goal?
1165,NH,3,7,P32,11,Please write back if you have time.
1166,NH,3,7,P32,12,I wish you the best of luck.
1167,NH,3,7,P32,13,"From your biggest fan, Takigawa Erika"
1168,NH,3,8,P34,1,Have you ever heard of “fair trade”?
1169,NH,3,8,P34,2,"Yes, I have."
1170,NH,3,8,P34,3,"No, I haven’t."
1171,NH,3,8,P34,4,Have you ever seen this mark?
1172,NH,3,8,P34,5,Yes. I’ve seen it before.
1173,NH,3,8,P34,6,I’ve seen it before.
1174,NH,3,8,P34,7,No.
1175,NH,3,8,P34,8,I’ve never seen it before.
1176,NH,3,8,P34,9,Come and discover the world of fair trade.
1177,NH,3,8,P36,10,"Chocolates, coffee, clothes…."
1178,NH,3,8,P36,11,Are these all fair trade products?
1179,NH,3,8,P36,12,Yes. 
1180,NH,3,8,P36,13,I’ve just taken a look at the pamphlet.
1181,NH,3,8,P36,14,It says more than fifty products are sold here.
1182,NH,3,8,P36,15,Have you looked at the prices yet?
1183,NH,3,8,P36,16,"No, not yet."
1184,NH,3,8,P36,17,Have you?
1185,NH,3,8,P36,18,Yes.
1186,NH,3,8,P36,18,I’ve already checked some products.
1187,NH,3,8,P36,19,They seem a little expensive.
1188,NH,3,8,P36,20,"Well, maybe the prices are “fair.”"
1189,NH,3,8,P38,21,Ghana produces a lot of cacao.
1190,NH,3,8,P38,22,It’s made into chocolate.
1191,NH,3,8,P38,23,Many cacao farm workers are very poor because cacao is sold at a low price.
1192,NH,3,8,P38,24,"They work hard, but they can’t make enough money to live."
1193,NH,3,8,P38,25,They work under “unfair” conditions.
1194,NH,3,8,P38,26,Many children in Ghana have to work on farms to help their families.
1195,NH,3,8,P38,27,Some of them have never been to school.
1196,NH,3,8,P38,28,Fair trade can solve these problems.
1197,NH,3,8,P38,29,"If you buy fair trade chocolate, more money goes to the workers."
1198,NH,3,8,P38,30,Your shopping choices can make a difference.
1199,NH,3,8,P40,31,"Hi, Alex."
1200,NH,3,8,P40,32,I enjoyed the event today.
1201,NH,3,8,P40,33,I’ve just tried some fair trade chocolate with my family.
1202,NH,3,8,P40,34,It was great.
1203,NH,3,8,P40,35,The children in today’s video don’t know that cacao is made into chocolate.
1204,NH,3,8,P40,36,They have never eaten chocolate themselves.
1205,NH,3,8,P40,37,I was surprised to hear that.
1206,NH,3,8,P40,38,What can we do for those children?
1207,NH,3,8,P40,39,I think choosing fair trade products is one way to support them.
1208,NH,3,8,P40,40,Learning about the people behind the products is another.
1209,NH,3,8,P40,41,I was glad to learn about fair trade today.
1210,NH,3,8,P40,42,I want to learn more.
1211,NH,3,8,P40,43,"Your friend, Saki"
1212,NH,3,9,P44,1,Have you ever been to the Statue of Liberty?
1213,NH,3,9,P44,2,"No, I haven’t."
1214,NH,3,9,P44,3,But I want to visit it someday.
1215,NH,3,9,P44,4,I’m going tomorrow.
1216,NH,3,9,P44,5,Would you like to come with me?
1217,NH,3,9,P44,6,I’d love to.
1218,NH,3,9,P44,7,When and where shall we meet?
1219,NH,3,9,P44,8,Let’s meet in front of your hotel at 10:30.
1220,NH,3,9,P44,9,Is that OK?
1221,NH,3,9,P44,10,At 10:30?
1222,NH,3,9,P44,11,That’s perfect.
1223,NH,3,9,P44,12,I’m looking forward to it.
1224,NH,3,9,P44,13,OK.
1225,NH,3,9,P44,14,See you then.
1226,NH,3,10,P50,1,We went to Kyoto on a school trip in June.
1227,NH,3,10,P50,2,Kyoto is an old city with many traditional buildings.
1228,NH,3,10,P50,3,My favorite was Kinkaku-ji.
1229,NH,3,10,P50,4,"One of my friends said, "
1230,NH,3,10,P50,5,“I’ve never seen such a beautiful temple before!”
1231,NH,3,10,P50,6,"I thought it was beautiful, too."
1232,NH,3,10,P50,7,I also enjoyed talking with my friends at night.
1233,NH,3,10,P50,8,I’ll never forget this trip.
1234,NH,3,11,P52,1,"Hello, everyone."
1235,NH,3,11,P52,2,My name is Paavo Laitinen.
1236,NH,3,11,P52,3,I’m a junior high school student in Finland.
1237,NH,3,11,P52,4,I’ve lived in Helsinki for more than ten years.
1238,NH,3,11,P52,5,"Last winter, we went to Lapland on a school trip."
1239,NH,3,11,P52,6,Lapland is a region in northern Finland.
1240,NH,3,11,P52,7,It has been popular among tourists for a long time because the nature there is really beautiful.
1241,NH,3,11,P52,8,"On the trip, we enjoyed many activities."
1242,NH,3,11,P52,9,My favorite activity was a husky tour.
1243,NH,3,11,P52,10,"We got on a sled, and huskies pulled it through the forest."
1244,NH,3,11,P52,11,It was very exciting.
1245,NH,3,11,P53,12,Seeing an aurora was also one of the purposes of this trip.
1246,NH,3,11,P53,13,Have you ever heard of auroras?
1247,NH,3,11,P53,14,We went to a vast snow field at night to see one.
1248,NH,3,11,P53,15,"Fortunately, the weather was perfect."
1249,NH,3,11,P53,16,We could see a band of bright green lights in the sky.
1250,NH,3,11,P53,17,"I said to myself, "
1251,NH,3,11,P53,18,“I’ve never seen such a beautiful aurora before.”
1252,NH,3,11,P53,19,I was very happy to see it.
1253,NH,3,11,P53,20,"In Lapland, I could feel a sense of living within nature."
1254,NH,3,11,P53,21,We can’t experience that in a city.
1255,NH,3,11,P53,22,This has become the best memory of my junior high school days so far.
1256,NH,3,12,P54,1,"A big, old tree stands by a road near the city of Hiroshima."
1257,NH,3,12,P54,2,"Through the years , it has seen many things."
1258,NH,3,12,P54,3,"One summer night, the tree heard a lullaby."
1259,NH,3,12,P54,4,A mother was singing to her little girl under the tree.
1260,NH,3,12,P54,5,"They looked happy, and the song sounded sweet."
1261,NH,3,12,P54,6,But the tree remembered something sad.
1262,NH,3,12,P54,7,“Yes. 
1263,NH,3,12,P54,8,It was some seventy years ago.
1264,NH,3,12,P54,9,"I heard a lullaby that night, too.”"
1265,NH,3,12,P55,10,"On the morning of that day, a big bomb fell on the city of Hiroshima."
1266,NH,3,12,P55,11,"Many people lost their lives, and many others were injured."
1267,NH,3,12,P55,12,They had burns all over their bodies.
1268,NH,3,12,P55,13,I was very sad when I saw those people.
1269,NH,3,12,P55,14,It was a very hot day.
1270,NH,3,12,P55,15,Some of the people fell down near me.
1271,NH,3,12,P55,16,"I said to them, “Come and rest in my shade."
1272,NH,3,12,P55,17,You’ll be all right soon.”
1273,NH,3,12,P56,18,Night came.
1274,NH,3,12,P56,19,Some people were already dead.
1275,NH,3,12,P56,20,I heard a weak voice.
1276,NH,3,12,P56,21,It was a lullaby.
1277,NH,3,12,P56,22,A young girl was singing to a little boy.
1278,NH,3,12,P56,23,“Mommy!
1279,NH,3,12,P56,23,Mommy!”
1280,NH,3,12,P56,23,the boy cried.
1281,NH,3,12,P56,24,"“Don’t cry,” the girl said."
1282,NH,3,12,P56,25,“Mommy is here.”
1283,NH,3,12,P56,26,Then she began to sing again.
1284,NH,3,12,P56,27,"She was very weak, but she tried to be a mother to the poor little boy."
1285,NH,3,12,P56,28,She held him in her arms like a real mother.
1286,NH,3,12,P57,29,"“Mommy,” the boy was still crying."
1287,NH,3,12,P57,30,"“Be a good boy,” said the girl."
1288,NH,3,12,P57,31,“You’ll be all right.”
1289,NH,3,12,P57,32,She held the boy more tightly and began to sing again.
1290,NH,3,12,P57,33,"After a while, the boy stopped crying and quietly died.  "
1291,NH,3,12,P57,34,But the little mother did not stop singing.
1292,NH,3,12,P57,35,It was a sad lullaby.
1293,NH,3,12,P57,36,The girl’s voice became weaker and weaker.
1294,NH,3,12,P57,37,"Morning came and the sun rose, but the girl never moved again."
1295,NH,3,13,P58,1,This Week’s Evacuation Drill
1296,NH,3,13,P58,2,Do you know what to do in an emergency?
1297,NH,3,13,P58,3,"In case of a fire, go outside."
1298,NH,3,13,P58,4,Walk fast. 
1299,NH,3,13,P58,5,Don’t run.
1300,NH,3,13,P58,6,"In case of an earthquake, cover your head first."
1301,NH,3,13,P58,7,Wait in a safe place until it stops.
1302,NH,3,13,P58,8,Learn how to protect yourself.
1303,NH,3,13,P60,9,It’s difficult for me to imagine a big earthquake.
1304,NH,3,13,P60,10,But one may happen at any time.
1305,NH,3,13,P60,11,That’s true.
1306,NH,3,13,P60,12,"So it’s necessary for us to prepare for disasters, right?"
1307,NH,3,13,P60,13,Yes.
1308,NH,3,13,P60,14,And I think it’s important to keep the past in mind.
1309,NH,3,13,P60,15,What do you mean?
1310,NH,3,13,P60,16,"Well, I’ll tell you a story."
1311,NH,3,13,P62,17,"On March 11, 2012, there was a special violin performance in the city of Rikuzentakata."
1312,NH,3,13,P62,18,The audience listened closely to the sound of the violin.
1313,NH,3,13,P62,19,Some of the people were in tears.
1314,NH,3,13,P62,20,That violin was very special to everyone there.
1315,NH,3,13,P62,21,"The violin was made by Nakazawa Muneyuki, a famous violin maker."
1316,NH,3,13,P62,22,"After the earthquake hit Japan in 2011, he wondered how to help as a craftsperson."
1317,NH,3,13,P62,23,Then he came up with an idea.
1318,NH,3,13,P62,24,It was to make violins from driftwood from the disaster.
1319,NH,3,13,P64,25,"Though it was not easy to make a violin from the driftwood, Mr. Nakazawa created some beautiful violins."
1320,NH,3,13,P64,26,The violins have a tender sound with the power to heal people.
1321,NH,3,13,P64,27,They have been passed around to many musicians.
1322,NH,3,13,P64,28,"As of January 2014, more than 200 musicians have played the violins."
1323,NH,3,13,P64,29,"Millions of people have listened to them at concerts or on TV not only in Japan, but also around the world."
1324,NH,3,13,P64,30,"“I want our future generations to play the violins, too,” said Mr. Nakazawa."
1325,NH,3,13,P64,31,“I want them to pass on the memories.”
1326,NH,3,14,P68,1,Excuse me.
1327,NH,3,14,P68,2,Could you tell me how to get to Kokuritsu-kyogijo Station?
1328,NH,3,14,P68,3,Sure.
1329,NH,3,14,P68,4,"Take the Ginza Line to Aoyama-itchome, and change trains there."
1330,NH,3,14,P68,5,I see.
1331,NH,3,14,P68,6,How many stops is Aoyama-itchome from here?
1332,NH,3,14,P68,7,Three stops.
1333,NH,3,14,P68,8,Which line should I take from Aoyama-itchome?
1334,NH,3,14,P68,9,Take the Oedo Line.
1335,NH,3,14,P68,10,It’s the train on Track 2.
1336,NH,3,14,P68,11,Thank you very much.
1337,NH,3,14,P68,12,My pleasure.
1338,NH,3,15,P70,1,Technology Meets Tradition
1339,NH,3,15,P70,2,Look at these robots playing the taiko drums.
1340,NH,3,15,P70,3,They were originally made as industrial robots.
1341,NH,3,15,P70,4,Now they are great musicians.
1342,NH,3,15,P70,5,Feel the traditional rhythms created by technology.
1343,NH,3,15,P72,6,Are you interested in robots?
1344,NH,3,15,P72,7,"Yes, especially robots made in Japan."
1345,NH,3,15,P72,8,Do you know what they can do?
1346,NH,3,15,P72,9,"I heard some of them can walk, talk, and even kick a ball."
1347,NH,3,15,P72,10,That’s right.
1348,NH,3,15,P72,11,"Not long ago, robots like those were just a dream."
1349,NH,3,15,P72,12,I know what you mean. 
1350,NH,3,15,P72,13,Our dreams are becoming reality.
1351,NH,3,15,P72,14,Exactly.
1352,NH,3,15,P74,15,"Today, let’s talk about living with robots."
1353,NH,3,15,P74,16,"Deepa, what do you think?"
1354,NH,3,15,P74,17,I think robots make our lives better because they help us in many ways.
1355,NH,3,15,P74,18,"Some robots can put together products, like cars or cameras."
1356,NH,3,15,P74,19,They do it quickly and precisely.
1357,NH,3,15,P74,20,Other robots can work in dangerous places instead of people.
1358,NH,3,15,P74,21,I agree with her in part.
1359,NH,3,15,P74,22,The robots working for us are amazing.
1360,NH,3,15,P74,23,But there’s also a big problem.
1361,NH,3,15,P74,24,Robots are so efficient that they’re taking people’s jobs away.
1362,NH,3,15,P74,25,I’m worried about losing our future jobs.
1363,NH,3,15,P76,26,Some robots work in hospitals and homes.
1364,NH,3,15,P76,27,I think they’re necessary for our future.
1365,NH,3,15,P76,28,The number of elderly people is increasing.
1366,NH,3,15,P76,29,"Future robots may be able to help them when they take a bath, or go shopping."
1367,NH,3,15,P76,30,"That’s true, but I’m a little afraid of living with robots."
1368,NH,3,15,P76,31,"If they get out of control, we don’t know what they’ll do."
1369,NH,3,15,P76,32,Robots are machines.
1370,NH,3,15,P76,33,They’re too dangerous to be our partners.
1371,NH,3,15,P76,34,"Thank you, everyone."
1372,NH,3,15,P76,35,"In my opinion, you should keep thinking about the best way to live with robots."
1373,NH,3,15,P76,36,It’s our future.
1374,NH,3,16,P80,1,Hello?
1375,NH,3,16,P80,2,"Hello, Mrs. Walker."
1376,NH,3,16,P80,3,This is Erika.
1377,NH,3,16,P80,4,"May I speak to Meg, please?"
1378,NH,3,16,P80,5,"I’m sorry, she’s out."
1379,NH,3,16,P80,6,Do you want her to call you back?
1380,NH,3,16,P80,7,"No, it’s OK."
1381,NH,3,16,P80,8,But can I leave a message?
1382,NH,3,16,P80,9,Sure.
1383,NH,3,16,P80,10,Could you tell her to come to my house at two?
1384,NH,3,16,P80,11,We’re going to do our papers together.
1385,NH,3,16,P80,12,OK. 
1386,NH,3,16,P80,13,Your house at two.
1387,NH,3,16,P80,14,Yes. 
1388,NH,3,16,P80,15,"Thank you, Mrs. Walker."
1389,NH,3,16,P80,16,You’re welcome.
1390,NH,3,16,P80,17,Say hello to your parents for me.
1391,NH,3,17,P82,1,This is a book I brought from the United States.
1392,NH,3,17,P82,2,These are some of the people I found in it.
1393,NH,3,17,P82,3,They’re all winners of the Nobel Peace Prize.
1394,NH,3,17,P82,4,Is there anyone you’ve seen before?
1395,NH,3,17,P84,5,I saw an impressive movie yesterday.
1396,NH,3,17,P84,6,What was it about?
1397,NH,3,17,P84,7,It was about the life of Aung San Suu Kyi.
1398,NH,3,17,P84,8,Is she the woman Ms. Baker talked about?
1399,NH,3,17,P84,9,Yes.
1400,NH,3,17,P84,10,She’s a political leader who fights for democracy and human rights in Myanmar.
1401,NH,3,17,P84,11,Sounds interesting.
1402,NH,3,17,P86,12,Political Life
1403,NH,3,17,P86,13,"In 1988, there was a movement for democracy in Myanmar."
1404,NH,3,17,P86,14,A great number of people who joined it were killed.
1405,NH,3,17,P86,15,"People needed a strong leader, and asked Aung San Suu Kyi to join them."
1406,NH,3,17,P86,16,"She accepted, and decided to work for her country."
1407,NH,3,17,P86,17,"In 1989, the government put her under house arrest to stop the movement."
1408,NH,3,17,P86,18,"She was locked up for 15 years in total, but she never gave up."
1409,NH,3,17,P86,19,"In 1991, she won the Nobel Peace Prize."
1410,NH,3,17,P86,20,It was a prize that attracted people’s attention.
1411,NH,3,17,P86,21,The world recognized her efforts for democracy and human rights.
1412,NH,3,17,P88,22,Personal Life
1413,NH,3,17,P88,23,"In 1999, Aung San Suu Kyi’s husband was dying of cancer."
1414,NH,3,17,P88,24,"She wanted to visit him in the U.K., but she could not leave her suffering people behind."
1415,NH,3,17,P88,25,"In the end, she stayed in Myanmar and never saw him again."
1416,NH,3,17,P88,26,It was a sad decision that they made together.
1417,NH,3,17,P88,27,"In 2010, she was finally set free."
1418,NH,3,17,P88,28,"She is still fighting for a world that is “free from the displaced, the homeless, and the hopeless.”"
1419,NH,3,17,P88,29,"The world that she wants may not come easily, but she keeps striving for it."
1420,NH,3,18,P92,1,"Many Japanese students wear school uniforms, but most American students do not."
1421,NH,3,18,P92,2, I think that we should have school uniforms.
1422,NH,3,18,P92,3,These are my reasons.
1423,NH,3,18,P92,4,"First, if we have school uniforms, we do not have to worry about what to wear every day."
1424,NH,3,18,P92,5,"Second, having school uniforms saves us money on clothes."
1425,NH,3,18,P92,6,"Third, when we wear school uniforms, we can feel that we belong to our school."
1426,NH,3,18,P92,7,School uniforms are good for students in many ways.
1427,NH,3,18,P92,8,I think that we should also have school uniforms in the United States.
1428,NH,3,19,P96,1,I’ve been a member of the volleyball team for three years.  
1429,NH,3,19,P96,2,"At first, it was difficult for us to win a game, but we’ve improved a lot.  "
1430,NH,3,19,P96,3,I’ll never forget winning the city championship.
1431,NH,3,19,P96,4,I’m going to keep playing volleyball.  
1432,NH,3,19,P96,5,I want to be a player who can lead a team to the national tournament.
1433,NH,3,20,P98,1,"Hi, everyone.  "
1434,NH,3,20,P98,2,"I’m Takigawa Erika, a 15-year-old girl living in New York.  "
1435,NH,3,20,P98,3,"I lived in Japan before, and moved here last year."
1436,NH,3,20,P98,4,"In New York, I’ve met people from all over the world.  "
1437,NH,3,20,P98,5,"There are students of various cultures in my school, too.  "
1438,NH,3,20,P98,6,It wasn’t easy for me to get along with them.  
1439,NH,3,20,P98,7,But a class called “Filmmaking” has changed me.
1440,NH,3,20,P98,8,Filmmaking is an elective class that is very popular in my school.  
1441,NH,3,20,P98,9,"In the class, students work in groups and learn how to make their own movies.  "
1442,NH,3,20,P98,10,My group had four members who all had different ideas and opinions.  
1443,NH,3,20,P98,11,So we discussed things a lot and sometimes argued.  
1444,NH,3,20,P98,12,"But as we were all working hard for the same goal, we came to accept one another.  "
1445,NH,3,20,P98,13,"We brought different ideas together, and completed a wonderful movie in the end.  "
1446,NH,3,20,P98,14,This is the greatest experience that I’ve had in my school life.  
1447,NH,3,20,P98,15,Filmmaking taught me to accept differences and learn from other people.  
1448,NH,3,20,P98,16,"I want everyone to learn the importance of respecting differences, and I believe there will be something I can do to help.  "
1449,NH,3,20,P98,17,"I’m still not sure what I can do, but I hope my experiences will help me to find a way."
1450,NH,3,21,P100,1,Rudolf read the card.  
1451,NH,3,21,P100,2,Only three words were written on it “The Green Door.”  
1452,NH,3,21,P100,3,A man who also received a card threw his away in front of Rudolf.  
1453,NH,3,21,P100,4,Rudolf picked it up.  
1454,NH,3,21,P100,5,It was just an advertisement for a dentist’s office.
1455,NH,3,21,P100,6,Rudolf wondered why and walked past the card man again.  
1456,NH,3,21,P100,7,He got another card with the words “The Green Door.”  
1457,NH,3,21,P100,8,"Many cards were thrown away on the street, but they were all for the dentist."
1458,NH,3,21,P100,9,"“Why did I receive these mysterious cards, not the dentist’s ones?”"
1459,NH,3,21,P100,10,Rudolf was sure that an adventure was waiting for him.
1460,NH,3,21,P101,11,"Behind the card man, Rudolf saw a building that had the dentist’s office and some shops on the first two floors.  "
1461,NH,3,21,P101,12,He entered the building and climbed to the third floor.  
1462,NH,3,21,P101,13,There was a dark hallway.  
1463,NH,3,21,P101,14,"On the left, he saw a green door.  "
1464,NH,3,21,P101,15,He walked straight to the door and knocked.
1465,NH,3,21,P101,16,"Slowly, the door opened.  "
1466,NH,3,21,P101,17,A young woman stood there.  
1467,NH,3,21,P101,18,She was pale and weak.  
1468,NH,3,21,P101,19,"She began to fall, but Rudolf caught her in his arms and carried her to a sofa in the room.  "
1469,NH,3,21,P101,20,"After a while, the woman opened her eyes. "
1470,NH,3,21,P101,21,"She was very beautiful, but also very thin."
1471,NH,3,21,P102,22,"The woman looked at Rudolf calmly, and smiled."
1472,NH,3,21,P102,23,"“I fainted, didn’t I?” she said.  "
1473,NH,3,21,P102,24,“I haven’t eaten for three days.”
1474,NH,3,21,P102,25,"“Oh, no!” cried Rudolf.  "
1475,NH,3,21,P102,26,“Wait!
1476,NH,3,21,P102,27,I’ll be right back.”
1477,NH,3,21,P102,28,He ran out of the room and came back with a lot of food.
1478,NH,3,21,P102,29,"“It’s ridiculous to go without eating,” said Rudolf."
1479,NH,3,21,P102,30,The woman began to eat and told him about herself.  
1480,NH,3,21,P102,31,Her story was nothing new.  
1481,NH,3,21,P102,32,She got sick and lost her job.  
1482,NH,3,21,P102,33,She ran out of money and stayed in her room without hope.  
1483,NH,3,21,P102,34,Then she heard the knock on her green door.
1484,NH,3,21,P103,35,“And you have no family or friends in the city?”
1485,NH,3,21,P103,35,asked Rudolf.
1486,NH,3,21,P103,36,“No.
1487,NH,3,21,P103,36,"Nobody,” answered the woman.  "
1488,NH,3,21,P103,37,"“Oh, now I’m sleepy, but I feel much better."
1489,NH,3,21,P103,38,Thank you.”
1490,NH,3,21,P103,39,"Rudolf said, “Well, good night."
1491,NH,3,21,P103,40,I’ll come back tomorrow to see how you are.”
1492,NH,3,21,P103,41,"At the door, she asked, “But why did you knock at my door?”"
1493,NH,3,21,P103,42,Rudolf did not think that he should tell her about the cards.
1494,NH,3,21,P103,43,"“By mistake,” he replied.  "
1495,NH,3,21,P103,44,He saw her smile as the door closed.
1496,NH,3,21,P103,45,Rudolf looked around more carefully in the hallway.  
1497,NH,3,21,P103,46,He realized that every door on that floor was green.
1498,NH,3,21,P104,47,"Rudolf stepped out on the street and asked the card man, "
1499,NH,3,21,P104,48,“Why did you give me these cards?”
1500,NH,3,21,P104,49,"The man pointed at a theater down the street and said, “They’re for a new show."
1501,NH,3,21,P104,49,I was handing them out with the dentist’s cards.”
1502,NH,3,21,P104,50,"Above the theater entrance, there was a big sign saying “The Green Door.”  "
1503,NH,3,21,P104,51,It was the title of a play.
1504,NH,3,21,P104,52,"On his way home, Rudolf thought about his day.  "
1505,NH,3,21,P104,53,"He said to himself, “Anyway, I believe fate guided me to her!”"
1506,NH,3,21,P104,54,There is always an adventure just around the corner . . .
1507,NH,3,21,P104,55,if you look for it.
1508,NH,3,21,P106,1,One photograph changed Hoshino Michio’s life.  
1509,NH,3,22,P106,2,"He was a university student, and one day he was looking at a book about Alaska.  "
1510,NH,3,22,P106,3,A photograph in the book caught his attention.  
1511,NH,3,22,P106,4,It was a photograph of a small village surrounded by wilderness.  
1512,NH,3,22,P106,5,Michio wanted to visit and experience that place for himself.  
1513,NH,3,22,P106,6,He wrote a letter to the mayor of the village.  
1514,NH,3,22,P106,7,"It took six months, but the mayor wrote back.  "
1515,NH,3,22,P106,8,"He invited Michio to Alaska, and Michio’s dream came true."
1516,NH,3,22,P107,9,"For one summer, Michio lived among the Inuit people in that Alaskan village.  "
1517,NH,3,22,P107,10,"He learned about Inuit food, family life, and culture.  "
1518,NH,3,22,P107,11,He also learned skills for living without city conveniences.  
1519,NH,3,22,P107,12,"For the Inuit, life depends on understanding nature.  "
1520,NH,3,22,P107,13,They have to hunt for meat and gather blueberries for food.  
1521,NH,3,22,P107,14,Michio saw how humans and animals shared the land.  
1522,NH,3,22,P107,15,"That summer, he became a part of the Alaskan wilderness, too."
1523,NH,3,22,P108,16,"After Michio finished university in Japan, he returned to Alaska.  "
1524,NH,3,22,P108,17,"For 19 years, he traveled around Alaska as a photographer.  "
1525,NH,3,22,P108,18,He often camped in severe weather to photograph animals in the wild.  
1526,NH,3,22,P108,19,Michio really used the survival skills the Inuit taught him.  
1527,NH,3,22,P108,20,Once he wrote about flying to the tundra to photograph caribou.  
1528,NH,3,22,P108,21,He stayed there alone for one month.  
1529,NH,3,22,P108,22,"As the plane left him, Michio felt lonely in a vast wilderness.  "
1530,NH,3,22,P108,23,"But even more, he felt incredibly free."
1531,NH,3,22,P109,24,Michio tried to show this feeling of freedom and wonder in his photographs.  
1532,NH,3,22,P109,25,He took playful photographs of polar bears and majestic photographs of Arctic mountains.
1533,NH,3,22,P109,26,"In 1996, he was killed by a bear as he camped alone in Kamchatka.  "
1534,NH,3,22,P109,27,"“We only have one life to live,” wrote Michio.  "
1535,NH,3,22,P109,28,"Though his life was cut short, Michio seemed truly happy as a photographer.  "
1536,NH,3,22,P109,29,He loved his work and he loved Alaska.
1537,NH,3,22,P110,30,"In Michio’s photographs, the beauty of Alaska will stay with us forever.  "
1538,NH,3,22,P110,31,That is the magic of photographs.  
1539,NH,3,22,P110,32,"However, the Alaskan wilderness is changing because of global warming.  "
1540,NH,3,22,P110,33,The Arctic glaciers are melting.  
1541,NH,3,22,P110,34,The polar bears and seals photographed by Michio cannot hunt and catch food.  
1542,NH,3,22,P110,35,The habitat of the caribou is growing smaller.  
1543,NH,3,22,P110,36,Even the Inuit are losing their traditional way of life.
1544,NH,3,22,P111,37,The Alaskan wilderness was special to Michio.  
1545,NH,3,22,P111,38,"He used his photographs to share it with us, "
1546,NH,3,22,P111,39,and to show us the importance of life on the Earth.  
1547,NH,3,22,P111,40,Michio’s own life was changed because of one photograph.  
1548,NH,3,22,P111,41,Perhaps his photographs will also change someone’s life.  
1549,NH,3,22,P111,42,Maybe Michio’s Alaskan photographs will encourage us to think about the beautiful Earth we share.
