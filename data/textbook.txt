Hello, everyone. I’m Anita Lopez from Venezuela. I like classical music. I like it because it’s very emotional. My family is poor, but I learn music thanks to a special program. The program is “El Sistema. ”In 1975, the government started it to help poor children in Venezuela. In this program, children can borrow instruments and become a member of an orchestra. The program is free. Can you believe it? Now El Sistema is one of the most famous educational programs in the world. More than 350,000 children are members. I joined the program five years ago. I play the violin. I really enjoy playing music with my friends in the orchestra. My life is happier than before. I think the power of music is great. 
 

P118　Let’s Read 3　Cooking with the Sun
Imagine that you live on a high mountain. There is no electricity or gas. You need to eat every day. So you have to find ways to heat and cook food. When you are in a place like this, you can use a solar cooker. You can also use one after a disaster. A solar cooker is a tool to heat food in a pot. It collects sunlight in the pot. It can cook rice, boil eggs, and even bake cakes. 
 

P119
A solar cooker is helpful to people in developing countries. Why? First, making a solar cooker does not cost much. You can make one with only cardboard and aluminum foil. Second, people in developing countries can get cleaner water by boiling it with a solar cooker. Drinking water from rivers and lakes is one of the biggest causes of disease. Third, a solar cooker is safe because it does not make smoke. More than one third of the people in the world burn firewood indoors to cook. A lot of children die from its smoke. 
 

P120
A solar cooker can solve another big problem because it does not use any fuel. People need a lot of wood to cook every day. Collecting wood is hard work, especially for women and children. With a solar cooker, they do not have to collect wood anymore. More than two billion people use wood to heat food. Cutting trees in forests adds to global warming. If you use one solar cooker, you can save about 550 kilograms of wood every year. 
 

P121
We use a lot of energy in our daily lives. We get most of this energy from gas and oil, but they are limited. A solar cooker uses solar power. It is an example of renewable energy. There are other examples of this energy, such as water, wind, and natural heat in the ground. Renewable energy facilities often cost a lot, but you may find a simple idea, like a solar cooker. Sometimes a simple idea has the power to change the world for the better.

Unit1 Pop Culture Then and Now

This is a famous painting by Vincent van Gogh. It is loved by many people. Van Gogh was influenced by ukiyo-e. Some ukiyo-e prints are shown in this painting. They were brought from Japan to Europe. 
P8
Was this picture also painted by the same person? Yes, it was. When was it painted? Is the year written in the book? Yes. It was painted in 1887. I see. At that time, Japanese culture was popular in Europe. Really? How about now? 
 

P10
Japanese Pop Culture around the WorldJapanese manga and anime characters are loved in many countries. Doraemon is one good example. In 2012, he was given special birthday parties in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Many Doraemon fans celebrated his 100-year "before" birthday. Another popular example of Japanese pop culture is the word "kawaii". "Kawaii " is also used outside Japan now. A lot of people are attracted by kawaii culture such as Hello Kitty goods and other unique designs. 
 
 
P12
Friday, April 22I read about ukiyo-e and Japanese pop culture today. I knew little about them before, but I learned that both are much loved in foreign countries. It makes me proud of Japan. I also learned that ukiyo-e was pop culture in Japan during the Edo period. In fact, ukiyo-e prints were sold like posters. I think manga and anime will be traditional Japanese arts like ukiyo-e someday. Maybe even kawaii culture can become a part of Japanese tradition. This idea makes me happy.

Hi, everyone. My name is Maile Johnson. I'm a high school student in Hawaii. Last summer, I met Sayuri, a 17-year-old Japanese student. She visited Hawaii to study English during her summer vacation. She stayed at our house for two weeks as a homestay student. We became very good friends. One day, she said to me, "Your father often wears aloha shirts to work. I like them. They're very Hawaiian. ""Yes, I like them, too. I also love Japanese clothes. I'm interested in Japanese kimonos, "I answered. 
 
 
P20　L. 12～
Actually, the first aloha shirts in Hawaii were made by people from Asia. They were made from Japanese kimonos. I told this story to Sayuri. It made her curious. "How were the kimonos brought from Japan to Hawaii?" she asked. Today aloha shirts are known around the world as example of Hawaiian culture. You can see them in many places. Cultures are mixing and the world is becoming smaller. Isn't that great?

Look at this picture. It looks like the sea, doesn't it? Actually, it's a river, the Amazon. It's the largest river in the world. The Amazon has been important to Brazil for many years. Its water power produces about eighty percent of Brazil's electricity. The Amazon has been helpful to everyone here, too. It runs through a huge rain forest. That forest produces about twenty percent of the world's oxygen. The oxygen in this classroom may come from Brazil! 
 
 
P28
The rain forest of the Amazon has many unique animals. These animals have been there for a long time, but they're losing their home now. People are destroying the rain forest. It has continued for years. Between the 1970s and 2010, about 740,000 square kilometers of the forest disappeared. That's almost twice the size of Japan. I've been worried about this problem since I was in elementary school. I want to become a scientist and do something for the plants and animals of the Amazon. The Amazon is treasure of the world.

Chocolates, coffee, clothes…. Are these all fair trade products? Yes. I’ve just taken a look at the pamphlet. It says more than fifty products are sold here. Have you looked at the prices yet? No, not yet. Have you? Yes. I’ve already checked some products. They seem a little expensive. Well, maybe the prices are “fair. ”
 

P38
Ghana produces a lot of cacao. It’s made into chocolate. Many cacao farm workers are very poor because cacao is sold at a low price. They work hard, but they can’t make enough money to live. They work under “unfair” conditions. Many children in Ghana have to work on farms to help their families. Some of them have never been to school. Fair trade can solve these problems. If you buy fair trade chocolate, more money goes to the workers. Your shopping choices can make a difference. 
 

P40
Hi, Alex. I enjoyed the event today. I’ve just tried some fair trade chocolate with my family. It was great. The children in today’s video don’t know that cacao is made into chocolate. They have never eaten chocolate themselves. I was surprised to hear that. What can we do for those children? I think choosing fair trade products is one way to support them.

A Mother’s Lullaby
A big, old tree stands by a road near the city of Hiroshima. Through the years , it has seen many things. One summer night, the tree heard a lullaby. A mother was singing to her little girl under the tree. They looked happy, and the song sounded sweet. But the tree remembered something sad. “Yes. It was some seventy years ago. I heard a lullaby that night, too. ”
 

P55
On the morning of that day, a big bomb fell on the city of Hiroshima. Many people lost their lives, and many others were injured. They had burns all over their bodies. I was very sad when I saw those people. It was a very hot day. Some of the people fell down near me. I said to them, “Come and rest in my shade. You’ll be all right soon. ”

She held him in her arms like a real mother.

“Mommy,” the boy was still crying. “Be a good boy,” said the girl. “You’ll be all right. ”She held the boy more tightly and began to sing again. 
After a while, the boy stopped crying and quietly died. But the little mother did not stop singing. It was a sad lullaby. The girl’s voice became weaker and weaker. Morning came and the sun rose, but the girl never moved again.

On March 11, 2012, there was a special violin performance in the city of Rikuzentakata. The audience listened closely to the sound of the violin. Some of the people were in tears. That violin was very special to everyone there. The violin was made by Nakazawa Muneyuki, a famous violin maker. After the earthquake hit Japan in 2011, he wondered how to help as a craftsperson. Then he came up with an idea. It was to make violins from driftwood from the disaster. 


P64
Though it was not easy to make a violin from the driftwood, Mr. Nakazawa created some beautiful violins. The violins have a tender sound with the power to heal people. They have been passed around to many musicians. As of January 2014, more than 200 musicians have played the violins. Millions of people have listened to them at concerts or on TV not only in Japan, but also around the world. “I want our future generations to play the violins, too,” said Mr. Nakazawa. “I want them to pass on the memories. ”

Filmmaking is an elective class that is very popular in my school. In the class, students work in groups and learn how to make their own movies. My group had four members who all had different ideas and opinions. So we discussed things a lot and sometimes argued. But as we were all working hard for the same goal, we came to accept one another. We brought different ideas together, and completed a wonderful movie in the end. This is the greatest experience that I’ve had in my school life. Filmmaking taught me to accept differences and learn from other people.

P100　Let’s Read 2　The Green Door
Rudolf read the card. Only three words were written on it “The Green Door. ”  A man who also received a card threw his away in front of Rudolf. Rudolf picked it uPIt was just an advertisement for a dentist’s office. Rudolf wondered why and walked past the card man again. He got another card with the words “The Green Door. ”  Many cards were thrown away on the street, but they were all for the dentist. “Why did I receive these mysterious cards, not the dentist’s ones? ”Rudolf was sure that an adventure was waiting for him. 
 
 
P101
Behind the card man, Rudolf saw a building that had the dentist’s office and some shops on the first two floors. He entered the building and climbed to the third floor. There was a dark hallway. On the left, he saw a green door. He walked straight to the door and knocked. Slowly, the door opened. A young woman stood there. She was pale and weak. She began to fall, but Rudolf caught her in his arms and carried her to a sofa in the room. After a while, the woman opened her eyes. She was very beautiful, but also very thin. 
 

P102
The woman looked at Rudolf calmly, and smiled. “I fainted, didn’t I? ” she said. “I haven’t eaten for three days. ”“Oh, no! ” cried Rudolf. “Wait! I’ll be right back. ”He ran out of the room and came back with a lot of food. “It’s ridiculous to go without eating,” said Rudolf. The woman began to eat and told him about herself. Her story was nothing new. She got sick and lost her job. She ran out of money and stayed in her room without hope. Then she heard the knock on her green door. 
 

P103
“And you have no family or friends in the city? ” asked Rudolf. “No. Nobody,” answered the woman. “Oh, now I’m sleepy, but I feel much better. Thank you. ”Rudolf said, “Well, good night. I’ll come back tomorrow to see how you are. ”At the door, she asked, “But why did you knock at my door? ”Rudolf did not think that he should tell her about the cards. “By mistake,” he replied. He saw her smile as the door closed. Rudolf looked around more carefully in the hallway. He realized that every door on that floor was green. 
 

P104
Rudolf stepped out on the street and asked the card man, “Why did you give me these cards? ”The man pointed at a theater down the street and said, “They’re for a new show. I was handing them out with the dentist’s cards. ”Above the theater entrance, there was a big sign saying “The Green Door. ”  It was the title of a play. On his way home, Rudolf thought about his day. He said to himself, “Anyway, I believe fate guided me to her! ”There is always an adventure just around the corner... if you look for it. 

 

P106　Let’s Read 3　An Artist in the Arctic
One photograph changed Hoshino Michio’s life. He was a university student, and one day he was looking at a book about Alaska. A photograph in the book caught his attention. It was a photograph of a small village surrounded by wilderness. Michio wanted to visit and experience that place for himself. He wrote a letter to the mayor of the village. It took six months, but the mayor wrote back. He invited Michio to Alaska, and Michio’s dream came true. 
 

P107
For one summer, Michio lived among the Inuit people in that Alaskan village. He learned about Inuit food, family life, and culture. He also learned skills for living without city conveniences. For the Inuit, life depends on understanding nature. They have to hunt for meat and gather blueberries for food. Michio saw how humans and animals shared the land. That summer, he became a part of the Alaskan wilderness, too. 
 

P108
After Michio finished university in Japan, he returned to Alaska. For 19 years, he traveled around Alaska as a photographer. He often camped in severe weather to photograph animals in the wild. Michio really used the survival skills the Inuit taught him. Once he wrote about flying to the tundra to photograph caribou. He stayed there alone for one month. As the plane left him, Michio felt lonely in a vast wilderness. But even more, he felt incredibly free. 
 

P109
Michio tried to show this feeling of freedom and wonder in his photographs. He took playful photographs of polar bears and majestic photographs of Arctic mountains. In 1996, he was killed by a bear as he camped alone in Kamchatka. “We only have one life to live,” wrote Michio. Though his life was cut short, Michio seemed truly happy as a photographer. He loved his work and he loved Alaska. 
 

P110
In Michio’s photographs, the beauty of Alaska will stay with us forever. That is the magic of photographs. However, the Alaskan wilderness is changing because of global warming. The Arctic glaciers are melting. The polar bears and seals photographed by Michio cannot hunt and catch food. The habitat of the caribou is growing smaller. Even the Inuit are losing their traditional way of life. 


P111
The Alaskan wilderness was special to Michio. He used his photographs to share it with us, and to show us the importance of life on the Earth. Michio’s own life was changed because of one photograph. Perhaps his photographs will also change someone’s life. Maybe Michio’s Alaskan photographs will encourage us to think about the beautiful Earth we share.
